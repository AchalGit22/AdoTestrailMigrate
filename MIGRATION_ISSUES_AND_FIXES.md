# Migration Issues and Fixes

## Issues Identified

### 1. Unicode Encoding Errors ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** The logging system couldn't display Unicode emoji characters (❌, ✅) on Windows due to cp1252 encoding limitations.

**Error:**
```
UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u274c' in position 34: character maps to <undefined>
```

**Fix Applied:**
- Added UTF-8 encoding configuration for Windows console output
- Added Unicode fallback logging function with ASCII alternatives
- Set file logging to use UTF-8 encoding

### 2. Azure DevOps Authentication Failure ❌ NEEDS ATTENTION
**Problem:** All Azure DevOps API calls are returning 401 Unauthorized errors.

**Error:**
```
❌ Failed to create suite 'Test1': 401 -
```

**Root Cause:** Personal Access Token (PAT) authentication is failing.

## Solutions

### For Unicode Issues (Already Fixed)
The code now includes:
1. Automatic UTF-8 console configuration for Windows
2. Fallback logging function that replaces Unicode characters with ASCII equivalents
3. Proper file encoding for log files

### For Authentication Issues (Action Required)

#### Step 1: Verify Your Azure DevOps PAT
Your current PAT: `1ibVmwpy5i...ASAZDO2Oor`

**To fix this, you need to:**

1. **Check if your PAT has expired**
   - Go to: https://dev.azure.com/amaditya902/_usersSettings/tokens
   - Check the expiration date of your current token

2. **Verify your PAT permissions**
   Your PAT must have these permissions:
   - ✅ **Test Management** (Read & Write)
   - ✅ **Work Items** (Read & Write)
   - ✅ **Project and Team** (Read)

3. **Create a new PAT if needed**
   - Go to: https://dev.azure.com/amaditya902/_usersSettings/tokens
   - Click "New Token"
   - Set name: "TestRail Migration"
   - Set expiration: 90 days (or as needed)
   - Select these scopes:
     - Test Management: Read & Write
     - Work Items: Read & Write
     - Project and Team: Read

4. **Verify your organization and project details**
   - Organization: `amaditya902`
   - Project: `TestPro`
   - Test Plan ID: `3`
   
   Double-check these values in your Azure DevOps portal.

#### Step 2: Test Authentication
Before running the migration, use the test script:

```bash
python3 test_auth.py
```

This will verify:
- Project access
- Test plan access  
- Work item creation permissions

#### Step 3: Update Configuration
Once you have a working PAT, update the `ADO_PAT` value in `testrail_to_ado_migration.py`:

```python
ADO_PAT = 'YOUR_NEW_WORKING_PAT_HERE'
```

## Running the Migration

Once authentication is working:

1. **Test first:**
   ```bash
   python3 test_auth.py
   ```

2. **Run migration:**
   ```bash
   python3 testrail_to_ado_migration.py
   ```

## Improvements Made to the Code

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Added authentication testing before migration starts
- Better error messages for 401 authentication failures
- Proper Unicode handling across platforms

### Better Logging
- UTF-8 support for console and file output
- Safe logging function with Unicode fallbacks
- More detailed error reporting

### Authentication Improvements
- Proper Base64 encoding for Authorization headers
- Explicit header inclusion in all API calls
- Pre-migration authentication validation

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix your Azure DevOps PAT (see Step 1 above)
2. ✅ Test authentication with `python3 test_auth.py`
3. ✅ Run the migration script
4. ✅ Monitor the logs for any remaining issues

The Unicode encoding issues are now resolved, and the authentication framework is in place. You just need to get a working PAT from Azure DevOps.
